I am a 5th year PhD candidate at the University of Notre Dame in the [Computer Vision Research Lab](https://cvrl.nd.edu). My research is at the intersection of signal processing, computer vision, and deep learning with applications in remote physiological measurement. I am fortunate to be advised by [Adam Czajka](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/adam-cza/) and [Patrick Flynn](https://sites.nd.edu/patrick-flynn/).

During the PhD I've interned at Philips and [Samsung Research America (SRA)](https://sra.samsung.com/research-area/digital-health/), in both cases working on camera-based sensing for cardiovascular monitoring.
