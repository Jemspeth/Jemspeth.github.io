I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at [Presage Technologies](https://www.presagetechnologies.com) working on camera-based blood pressure estimation. Before that I completed my PhD at the University of Notre Dame in the [Computer Vision Research Lab](https://cvrl.nd.edu). My research is at the intersection of signal processing, computer vision, and deep learning with applications in remote physiological measurement. I was fortunate to be advised by [Adam Czajka](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/adam-cza/) and [Patrick Flynn](https://sites.nd.edu/patrick-flynn/).

I've previously interned at Philips and [Samsung Research America (SRA)](https://sra.samsung.com/research-area/digital-health/), in both cases working on camera-based sensing for cardiovascular monitoring.
