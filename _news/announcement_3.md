After 4.5 years at University of Notre Dame, my time has come to an end. I succesfully defended my dissertation titled, "Remote Physiological Measurement in an Open World". These last years have been the most fulfilling of my life. I am extremely grateful for my friends, colleagues, and advisors for all of their support along the way.
