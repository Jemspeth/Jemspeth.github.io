I'm excited to announce that I'll be joining Presage Technologies as a Senior Research Scientist! It is bittersweet moving on from the CVRL, but I am eager to bring camera-based physiological measurement to the market for everyone to use. I'll be primarily focusing on improving rPPG and blood pressure estimation from video.
