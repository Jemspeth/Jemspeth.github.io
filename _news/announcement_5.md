I'm honored to have received the 2024 IEEE Biometrics Council **Best Dissertation Award**! It's awarded once a year to only one PhD graduate (globally) working in biometrics. I will be presenting my PhD work at IJCB 2024 in Buffalo, NY between September 11th and 15th. Please reach out if you're attending and want to talk anything related to camera-based physiology!

I'm very grateful to my advisors Adam Czajka and Patrick Flynn and my collaborators in the CVRL at Notre Dame for their immense contributions to my dissertation throughout the PhD. Find my dissertation [here](https://curate.nd.edu/articles/thesis/Remote_Physiological_Measurement_in_an_Open_World/24884337) if you are interested.
