I gave an invited talk to Google X's [Tidal](https://x.company/projects/tidal/) team on unsupervised learning from video (primarily focused on camera-based vitals).
Many thanks to Sophia Abraham for inviting me, Cory Schillaci for organizing, and the rest of the Tidal team for great questions and discussions!
